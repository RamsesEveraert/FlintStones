# FlintStones
**First Year Exam Assignment - Programming c++**

For our first-year programming 1 course, we were tasked with applying everything we had learned to create a clone of a game of our choice. The teachers provided us with a basic framework, which we had to complete on our own to successfully recreate a 2D platformer game.

I chose to recreate The Flintstones because it presented several challenges I wanted to tackle: parallax scrolling, ledge grabbing, complex 2D animations, and more realistic physics. These aspects offered a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of C++ and the mechanics of 2D platformer games.
